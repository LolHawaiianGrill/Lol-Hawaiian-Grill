                LOL Hawaiian Grill is owned and operated by the Toleafoa (toe-lay-uh-foe-uh) family. 
                Lana, Lopi, Junior, and Juanina (Nina).

                In 2011 The Toleafoaâ€™s moved from Hawaii to Utah and set up shop in American Fork. 
                LOL Island Stylin was a unique store that featured polynesian art, fashion and food. 
                The crowds began to come and the big draw was their truely, authentic polynesian cooking. 
                Stepping into their store was like stepping into an island family kitchen. 
                Good food filled the air and the the stomaches of all who entered.

                In 2015 they completed a total remodel of the store to accomodate for their large following and for special events. 
                LOL had become a social gathering place for all, but espechially for Polynesians wanting a taste of home.

                The Toleafoas were surprised in the middle of 2016 when they were not able to renew their lease. 
                They began a search for a new place to settle. 
                In the meantime they purchased a food truck and continued to serve their strong following in Utah county.

                Near end of 2016 the store was reopened and rebranded in Sandy City as LOL Hawaiian Grill. 
                Their unique brand continues to draw in the crowds, especially Thursday - Saturday (the Poly Plate days).
